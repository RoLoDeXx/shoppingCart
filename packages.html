      <h3>ABOUT BALI</h3>
      Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as
      painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts.
      Balinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music,
      known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts
      often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy
      Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris,
      topeng, barong, gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one
      of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world,
      with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private
      ceremonies, or public shows.

      <h3>ABOUT CAPE TOWN</h3>
      Cape Town is not only a popular international tourist destination in South
      Africa, but Africa as a whole. This is due to its mild climate, natural
      setting, and well-developed infrastructure. The city has several
      well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably Table
      Mountain, which forms a large part of the Table Mountain National Park and
      is the back end of the City Bowl. Reaching the top of the mountain can be
      achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the Table Mountain Cableway.
      Cape Point is recognised as the dramatic headland at the end of the Cape
      Peninsula. Many tourists also drive along Chapman's Peak Drive, a narrow
      road that links Noordhoek with Hout Bay, for the views of the Atlantic
      Ocean and nearby mountains. It is possible to either drive or hike up
      Signal Hill for closer views of the City Bowl and Table Mountain.

      <h3>ABOUT MALAYSIA</h3>
      Malaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society. The
      original culture of the area stemmed from indigenous tribes that inhabited
      it, along with the Malays who later moved there. Substantial influence
      exists from Chinese and Indian culture, dating back to when foreign trade
      began. Other cultural influences include the Persian, Arabic, and British
      cultures. Due to the structure of the government, coupled with the social
      contract theory, there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic
      minorities.

      <h3>ABOUT MAURITIUS</h3>
      The island of Mauritius is relatively young geologically, having been
      created by volcanic activity some 8 million years ago. Together with Saint
      Brandon, Réunion, and Rodrigues, the island is part of the Mascarene
      Islands. These islands emerged as a result of gigantic underwater volcanic
      eruptions that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of the
      continental block made up of Africa and Madagascar. They are no longer
      volcanically active and the hotspot now rests under Réunion Island.
      Mauritius is encircled by a broken ring of mountain ranges, varying in
      height from 300–800 m (1,000–2,600 ft) above sea level. The land rises
      from coastal plains to a central plateau where it reaches a height of 670
      m (2,200 ft); the highest peak is in the southwest, Piton de la Petite
      Rivière Noire at 828 metres (2,717 ft). Streams and rivers speckle the
      island, many formed in the cracks created by lava flows.

      <h3>ABOUT NYC</h3>
      New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by
      the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York's Baruch
      College. A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture
      Capital of the World, 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by
      the National Library of Australia. In describing New York, author Tom
      Wolfe said, "Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the
      weather."Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city,
      such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American
      literary canon in the United States. The city was a center of jazz in the
      1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop
      in the 1970s. The city's punk and hardcore scenes were influential in the
      1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish
      American literature. The city is the birthplace of many cultural
      movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art;
      abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting;
      and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz,
      and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York City has been
      considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the
      setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and
      television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's
      preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.
      New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the
      world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.

      <h3>ABOUT SINGAPORE</h3>
      The first records of Singapore date back to the second and third centuries
      where a vague reference to its location was found in Greek and Chinese
      texts, under the names of Sabana and Pu Luo Chung respectively. According
      to legend, Srivijayan prince Sang Nila Utama landed on the island and,
      catching sight of a strange creature that he thought was a lion, decided
      to find a new city he called Singapura, Sanskrit for Lion City, c. 1299.
      Alas, there have never been any lions anywhere near Singapore (until the
      Singapore Zoo opened) or elsewhere on Malaya in historical times, so the
      mysterious beast was more probably a tiger or wild boar. More historical
      records indicate that the island was settled at least two centuries
      earlier and was known as Temasek, Javanese for "Sea Town", and an
      important port for the Sumatran Srivijaya kingdom. However, Srivijaya fell
      around 1400 and Temasek, battered by the feuding kingdoms of Siam and the
      Javanese Majapahit, fell into obscurity. As Singapura, it then briefly
      regained importance as a trading centre for the Melaka Sultanate and
      later, the Johor Sultanate. However, Portuguese raiders then destroyed the
      settlement and Singapura faded into obscurity once more.
